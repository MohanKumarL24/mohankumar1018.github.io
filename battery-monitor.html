    <p><strong>2024</strong></p>
    <p>
      This ESP32-based project tracks and displays critical battery parameters such as voltage, current, and temperature in real time. The data is streamed to the Blynk IoT dashboard and visualized using graphs and digital indicators, enabling users to monitor battery health remotely.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is designed for integration into energy systems such as solar installations or electric vehicles, where battery maintenance is crucial. The system also includes warning notifications when abnormal conditions (like overheating or deep discharge) are detected.
