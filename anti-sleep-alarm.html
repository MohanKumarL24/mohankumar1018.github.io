      This safety system helps prevent road accidents caused by drowsiness in drivers. It is based on an Arduino Nano and an IR eye blink sensor that monitors the driver's eye movements. If prolonged eye closure is detected (indicating sleepiness), the system immediately activates a buzzer to alert the driver.
    </p>

      The device is lightweight, wearable, and can be installed inside a vehicle. It is especially useful for truck and cab drivers who frequently drive long distances. Further upgrades may include GSM modules for emergency alert systems.
